# Bitcoin-Alert-System-using-IoT-
Using this project, you can alert yourself when the Bitcoin price is right to sell. The system checks the current price of the Bitcoin currency every 5 seconds and checks if it is greater than our defined selling price. If the market price is greater, then it will tell the Bolt to sound an alert via the connected buzzer.
This project must be done after purchasing Bolt IoT kit which one can buy at this website : https://www.boltiot.com/
